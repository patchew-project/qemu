##
# @EbpfObject:
#
# An eBPF ELF object.

# @object: the eBPF object encoded in base64

# Since: 8.2

# @EbpfProgramID:
#
# The eBPF programs that can be gotten with request-ebpf.
#
# @rss: Receive side scaling, technology that allows steering traffic
#     between queues by calculation hash.  Users may set up
#     indirection table and hash/packet types configurations.  Used
#     with virtio-net.

# Since: 8.2

##
# @request-ebpf:
#
# Retrieve an eBPF object that can be loaded with libbpf.  Management
# applications (g.e. libvirt) may load it and pass file descriptors to
# QEMU, so they can run running QEMU without BPF capabilities.
#
# @id: The ID of the program to return.
#
# Returns: eBPF object encoded in base64.
#
# Since: 8.2
