# @rtc-reset-reinjection:
#
# This command will reset the RTC interrupt reinjection backlog.
# Can be used if another mechanism to synchronize guest time
# is in effect, for example QEMU guest agent's guest-set-time
# command.
#
# Since: 2.1
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "rtc-reset-reinjection" }
# <- { "return": {} }
#

# @dump-skeys:
#
# Dump guest's storage keys
#
# @filename: the path to the file to dump to
#
# This command is only supported on s390 architecture.
#
# Since: 2.5
#
# Example:
#
# -> { "execute": "dump-skeys",
#      "arguments": { "filename": "/tmp/skeys" } }
# <- { "return": {} }

# @query-cpu-model-comparison:
#
# Compares two CPU models, returning how they compare in a specific
# configuration. The results indicates how both models compare regarding
# runnability. This result can be used by tooling to make decisions if a
# certain CPU model will run in a certain configuration or if a compatible
# CPU model has to be created by baselining.
#
# Usually, a CPU model is compared against the maximum possible CPU model
# of a certain configuration (e.g. the "host" model for KVM). If that CPU
# model is identical or a subset, it will run in that configuration.
#
# The result returned by this command may be affected by:
#
# * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the QEMU version.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the machine-type.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * machine options (including accelerator): in some architectures, CPU models
#   may look different depending on machine and accelerator options. (Except for
#   CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu option and
#   global properties may affect expansion of CPU models. Using
#   query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is not advised.
#
# Some architectures may not support comparing CPU models. s390x supports
# comparing CPU models.
#
# Returns: a CpuModelBaselineInfo. Returns an error if comparing CPU models is
#          not supported, if a model cannot be used, if a model contains
#          an unknown cpu definition name, unknown properties or properties
#          with wrong types.
#
# Note: this command isn't specific to s390x, but is only implemented
# on this architecture currently.
#
# Since: 2.8.0

# @query-cpu-model-baseline:
#
# Baseline two CPU models, creating a compatible third model. The created
# model will always be a static, migration-safe CPU model (see "static"
# CPU model expansion for details).
#
# This interface can be used by tooling to create a compatible CPU model out
# two CPU models. The created CPU model will be identical to or a subset of
# both CPU models when comparing them. Therefore, the created CPU model is
# guaranteed to run where the given CPU models run.
#
# The result returned by this command may be affected by:
#
# * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the QEMU version.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
