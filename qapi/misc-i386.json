# @rtc-reset-reinjection:
#
# This command will reset the RTC interrupt reinjection backlog.  Can
# be used if another mechanism to synchronize guest time is in effect,
# for example QEMU guest agent's guest-set-time command.
#
# Use of this command is only applicable for x86 machines with an RTC,
# and on other machines will silently return without performing any
# action.
#
# Since: 2.1
#
# .. qmp-example::
#
#     -> { "execute": "rtc-reset-reinjection" }
#     <- { "return": {} }
