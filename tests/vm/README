=== VM test suite to run build in guests ===

== Intro ==

This test suite contains scripts that bootstrap various guest images that have
necessary packages to build QEMU. The basic usage is documented in Makefile
help which is displayed with "make vm-test".

== Quick start ==

Run "make vm-test" to list available make targets.

== Manual invocation ==

Each guest script is an executable script with the same command line options.
For example to work with the netbsd guest, use $QEMU_SRC/tests/vm/netbsd:

    $ cd $QEMU_SRC/tests/vm

    # To bootstrap the image
    $ ./netbsd --build-image --image /var/tmp/netbsd.img
    <...>

    # To run an arbitrary command in guest (the output will not be echoed unless
    # --debug is added)
    $ ./netbsd --debug --image /tmp/netbsd.img uname -a

    # To build QEMU in guest
    $ ./netbsd --debug --image /tmp/netbsd.img --build-qemu $QEMU_SRC

    # To get to an interactive shell
    $ ./netbsd --interactive --image /tmp/netbsd.img sh

== Adding new guests ==

Please look at existing guest scripts for how to add new guests.

Most importantly, create a subclass of BaseVM and implement build_image()
method and define BUILD_SCRIPT, then finally call basevm.main() from the
script's main().

  - Usually in build_image(), a template image is downloaded from a predefined
    URL. BaseVM._download_with_cache() takes care of the cache and the
    checksum, so consider using it.

  - Once the image is downloaded, users, SSH server and QEMU build deps should
    be set up:

    * Root password set to BaseVM.ROOT_PASS
    * User BaseVM.GUEST_USER is created, and password set to BaseVM.GUEST_PASS
    * SSH service is enabled and started on boot, BaseVM.SSH_PUB_KEY is added
      to authorized_keys of both root and the normal user
    * DHCP client service is enabled and started on boot, so that it can
      automatically configure the virtio-net-pci NIC and communicate with QEMU
      user net (10.0.2.2)
    * Necessary packages are installed to untar the source tarball and build
      QEMU

  - Write a proper BUILD_SCRIPT template, which should be a shell script that
    untars a raw virtio-blk block device, which is the tarball data blob of the
    QEMU source tree, then configure/build it. Running "make check" is also
    recommended.
