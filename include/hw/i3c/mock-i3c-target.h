 * Mock I3C Device
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2025 Google LLC
 *
 * The mock I3C device can be thought of as a simple EEPROM. It has a buffer,
 * and the pointer in the buffer is reset to 0 on an I3C STOP.
 * To write to the buffer, issue a private write and send data.
 * To read from the buffer, issue a private read.
 *
 * The mock target also supports sending target interrupt IBIs.
 * To issue an IBI, set the 'ibi-magic-num' property to a non-zero number, and
 * send that number in a private transaction. The mock target will issue an IBI
 * after 1 second.
 *
 * It also supports a handful of CCCs that are typically used when probing I3C
 * devices.
