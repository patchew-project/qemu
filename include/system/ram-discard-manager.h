/**
 * RamDiscardManager:
 *
 * A #RamDiscardManager coordinates which parts of specific RAM #MemoryRegion
 * regions are currently populated to be used/accessed by the VM, notifying
 * after parts were discarded (freeing up memory) and before parts will be
 * populated (consuming memory), to be used/accessed by the VM.
 *
 * A #RamDiscardManager can only be set for a RAM #MemoryRegion while the
 * #MemoryRegion isn't mapped into an address space yet (either directly
 * or via an alias); it cannot change while the #MemoryRegion is
 * mapped into an address space.
 *
 * The #RamDiscardManager is intended to be used by technologies that are
 * incompatible with discarding of RAM (e.g., VFIO, which may pin all
 * memory inside a #MemoryRegion), and require proper coordination to only
 * map the currently populated parts, to hinder parts that are expected to
 * remain discarded from silently getting populated and consuming memory.
 * Technologies that support discarding of RAM don't have to bother and can
 * simply map the whole #MemoryRegion.
 *
 * An example #RamDiscardSource is virtio-mem, which logically (un)plugs
 * memory within an assigned RAM #MemoryRegion, coordinated with the VM.
 * Logically unplugging memory consists of discarding RAM. The VM agreed to not
 * access unplugged (discarded) memory - especially via DMA. virtio-mem will
 * properly coordinate with listeners before memory is plugged (populated),
 * and after memory is unplugged (discarded).
 *
 * Listeners are called in multiples of the minimum granularity (unless it
 * would exceed the registered range) and changes are aligned to the minimum
 * granularity within the #MemoryRegion. Listeners have to prepare for memory
 * becoming discarded in a different granularity than it was populated and the
 * other way around.
