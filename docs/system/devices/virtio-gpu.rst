virtio-gpu
==========

This document explains the setup and usage of the virtio-gpu device.
The virtio-gpu device provides a GPU and display controller
paravirtualized using VirtIO. It supports a number of different modes
from simple 2D displays to fully accelerated 3D graphics.

Linux guest kernel support
--------------------------

virtio-gpu requires a guest Linux kernel built with the
``CONFIG_DRM_VIRTIO_GPU`` option.

3D acceleration
---------------

3D acceleration of a virtualized GPU is still an evolving field.
Depending on the 3D mode you are running you may need to override
distribution supplied libraries with more recent versions or enable
build options. There are a number of requirements the host must meet
to be able to be able to support guests. QEMU must be able to access the
host's GPU and for the best performance be able to reliably share GPU
memory with the guest. Details of 3D acceleration requirements are
described in a further sections.

QEMU virtio-gpu variants
------------------------

QEMU virtio-gpu device variants come in the following form:

 * ``virtio-vga[-BACKEND]``
 * ``virtio-gpu[-BACKEND][-INTERFACE]``
 * ``vhost-user-vga``
 * ``vhost-user-pci``

**Backends:** QEMU provides a 2D virtio-gpu backend, and two accelerated
backends: virglrenderer ('gl' device label) and rutabaga_gfx ('rutabaga'
device label).  There is a vhost-user backend that runs the graphics stack
in a separate process for improved isolation.

**Interfaces:** QEMU further categorizes virtio-gpu device variants based
on the interface exposed to the guest. The interfaces can be classified
into VGA and non-VGA variants. The VGA ones are prefixed with virtio-vga
or vhost-user-vga while the non-VGA ones are prefixed with virtio-gpu or
vhost-user-gpu.

The VGA ones always use the PCI interface, but for the non-VGA ones, the
user can further pick between MMIO or PCI. For MMIO, the user can suffix
the device name with -device, though vhost-user-gpu does not support MMIO.
For PCI, the user can suffix it with -pci. Without these suffixes, the
platform default will be chosen.

virtio-gpu 2d
-------------

The default 2D backend only performs 2D operations. The guest needs to
employ a software renderer for 3D graphics.

Typically, the software renderer is provided by `Mesa`_ or `SwiftShader`_.
Mesa's implementations (LLVMpipe, Lavapipe and virgl below) work out of box
on typical modern Linux distributions.

virtio-gpu virglrenderer
------------------------

When using `virgl`_ accelerated graphics mode in the guest, OpenGL API calls
are translated into an intermediate representation (see `Gallium3D`_). The
intermediate representation is communicated to the host and the
`virglrenderer`_ library on the host translates the intermediate
representation back to OpenGL API calls.

By default OpenGL version on guest is limited to 4.3. In order to enable
OpenGL 4.6 support, virtio-gpu  host blobs feature (``hostmem`` and ``blob``
fields) should be enabled.  The ``hostmem`` field specifies the size of
virtio-gpu host memory window. This is typically between 256M and 8G.

    -device virtio-gpu-gl

.. _Gallium3D: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gallium/
.. _virglrenderer: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer/

Translation of Vulkan API calls is supported since release of `virglrenderer`_
v1.0.0 using `venus`_ protocol. ``Venus`` virtio-gpu capability set ("capset")
requires host blob support (``hostmem`` and ``blob`` fields) and should
be enabled using ``venus`` field. The ``hostmem`` field specifies the size
of virtio-gpu host memory window. This is typically between 256M and 8G.

.. parsed-literal::
    -device virtio-gpu-gl,hostmem=8G,blob=true,venus=true

.. _venus: https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/venus.html

DRM native context is supported since release of `virglrenderer`_ v1.0.0
using `drm`_ protocol.  ``DRM`` virtio-gpu capability set ("capset") requires
host blob support (``hostmem`` and ``blob`` fields) and should be enabled
using ``drm_native_context`` field.  The ``hostmem`` field specifies the size
of virtio-gpu host memory window. This is typically between 256M and 8G.

virtio-gpu rutabaga
-------------------

virtio-gpu can also leverage rutabaga_gfx to provide `gfxstream`_
rendering and `Wayland display passthrough`_.  With the gfxstream rendering
mode, GLES and Vulkan calls are forwarded to the host with minimal
modification.

The crosvm book provides directions on how to build a `gfxstream-enabled
rutabaga`_ and launch a `guest Wayland proxy`_.

This device does require host blob support (``hostmem`` field below). The
``hostmem`` field specifies the size of virtio-gpu host memory window.
This is typically between 256M and 8G.

At least one virtio-gpu capability set ("capset") must be specified when
starting the device.  The currently capsets supported are ``gfxstream-vulkan``
and ``cross-domain`` for Linux guests. For Android guests, the experimental
``x-gfxstream-gles`` and ``x-gfxstream-composer`` capsets are also supported.

The device will try to auto-detect the wayland socket path if the
``cross-domain`` capset name is set.  The user may optionally specify
``wayland-socket-path`` for non-standard paths.

The ``wsi`` option can be set to ``surfaceless`` or ``headless``.
Surfaceless doesn't create a native window surface, but does copy from the
render target to the Pixman buffer if a virtio-gpu 2D hypercall is issued.
Headless is like surfaceless, but doesn't copy to the Pixman buffer.
Surfaceless is the default if ``wsi`` is not specified.
