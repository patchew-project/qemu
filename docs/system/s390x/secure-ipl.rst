Secure IPL Command Line Options
===============================

The s390-ccw-virtio machine type supports secure IPL. These parameters allow
users to provide certificates and enable secure IPL directly via the command
line.

Providing Certificates
----------------------

The certificate store can be populated by supplying a list of X.509 certificate
file paths or directories containing certificate files on the command-line:

Note: certificate files must have a .pem extension.

.. code-block:: shell

    qemu-system-s390x -machine s390-ccw-virtio,boot-certs.0.path=/.../qemu/certs,boot-certs.1.path=/another/path/cert.pem ...

Enabling Secure IPL
-------------------

Secure IPL is enabled by explicitly setting ``secure-boot=on``; if not
specified, secure boot is considered off.

.. code-block:: shell

    qemu-system-s390x -machine s390-ccw-virtio,secure-boot=on|off


IPL Modes
=========
Multiple IPL modes are available to differentiate between the various IPL
configurations. These modes are mutually exclusive and enabled based on specific
combinations of the ``secure-boot`` and ``boot-certs`` options on the QEMU
command line.

Normal Mode
-----------

The absence of both certificates and the ``secure-boot`` option will attempt to
IPL a guest without secure IPL operations. No checks are performed, and no
warnings/errors are reported.  This is the default mode, and can be explicitly
enabled with ``secure-boot=off``.

Configuration:

.. code-block:: shell

    qemu-system-s390x -machine s390-ccw-virtio ...

Audit Mode
----------

When the certificate store is populated with at least one certificate
and no additional secure IPL parameters are provided on the command
line, then secure IPL will proceed in "audit mode". All secure IPL
operations will be performed with signature verification errors reported
as non-disruptive warnings.

Configuration:

.. code-block:: shell

    qemu-system-s390x -machine s390-ccw-virtio,boot-certs.0.path=/.../qemu/certs,boot-certs.1.path=/another/path/cert.pem ...
