# q35 - VirtIO guest (graphical console)
# =========================================================
#
# You will probably need to tweak the lines marked as
# CHANGE ME before being able to use this configuration!
#
# Usage:
#
#   $ qemu-system-x86_64 \
#     -nodefaults \
#     -readconfig q35-virtio-graphical.cfg
#
# The guest will have a selection of VirtIO devices
# tailored towards optimal performance with modern guests,
# and will be accessed through a graphical console.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Using -nodefaults is required to have full control over
# the virtual hardware: when it's specified, QEMU will
# create a bare machine with just the very essential
# chipset devices being present:
#
#   00:00.0 Host bridge
#   00:1f.0 ISA bridge / LPC
#   00:1f.2 SATA (AHCI) controller
#   00:1f.3 SMBus controller
#
# This configuration file adds a number of other useful
# devices, more specifically:
#
#   00:01.0 VGA compatible controller
#   00:1b.0 Audio device
#   00.1c.* PCI bridge (PCI Express Root Ports)
#   01:00.0 SCSI storage controller
#   02:00.0 Ethernet controller
#   03:00.0 USB controller
#
# More information about these devices is available below.


# Machine options
# =========================================================
#
# We use the q35 machine type and enable KVM acceleration
# for better performance.
#
# Using less than 1 GiB of memory is probably not going to
# yield good performance in the guest, and might even lead
# to obscure boot issues in some cases.
#
# Unfortunately, there is no way to configure the CPU model
# in this file, so it will have to be provided on the
# command line.

# PCI bridge (PCI Express Root Ports)
# =========================================================
#
# We create eight PCI Express Root Ports, and we plug them
# all into separate functions of the same slot. Some of
# them will be used by devices, the rest will remain
# available for hotplug.

# SCSI storage controller (and storage)
# =========================================================
#
# We use virtio-scsi here so that we can (hot)plug a large

# backed by a qcow2 disk image on the host's filesystem, is
# attached to it.

# Ethernet controller
# =========================================================

# USB controller (and input devices)
# =========================================================
#
# We add a virtualization-friendly USB 3.0 controller and
# a USB tablet so that graphical guests can be controlled
# appropriately. A USB keyboard is not needed, as q35
# guests get a PS/2 one added automatically.

# =========================================================
#
# We plug the QXL video card directly into the PCI Express
# Root Bus as it is a legacy PCI device; this way, we can
# reduce the number of PCI Express controllers in the
# guest.
#
# If you're running the guest on a remote, potentially
# headless host, you will probably want to append something
# like
#
#   -display vnc=127.0.0.1:0
#
# to the command line in order to prevent QEMU from trying
# to display a GTK+ window on the host and enable remote
# access instead.
