Security Process
================

Please report any suspected security issue in QEMU to the security
mailing list at:

-  `<qemu-security@nongnu.org> <https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-security>`__

To report an issue via `GPG <https://gnupg.org/>`__ encrypted email,
please send it to the Red Hat Product Security team at:

-  `<secalert@redhat.com> <https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact/#contact>`__

**Note:** after the triage, encrypted issue details shall be sent to the
upstream ‘qemu-security’ mailing list for archival purposes.

How to report an issue
----------------------

-  Please include as many details as possible in the issue report. Ex:

   -  QEMU version, upstream commit/tag
   -  Host & Guest architecture x86/Arm/PPC, 32/64 bit etc.
   -  Affected code area/snippets
   -  Stack traces, crash details
   -  Malicious inputs/reproducer steps etc.
   -  Any configurations/settings required to trigger the issue.

-  Please share the QEMU command line used to invoke a guest VM.

-  Please specify whom to acknowledge for reporting this issue.

How we respond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Process of handling security issues comprises following steps:

   0) **Acknowledge:**

   -  A non-automated response email is sent to the reporter(s) to
      acknowledge the reception of the report. (*60 day’s counter starts
      here*)

   1) **Triage:**

   -  Examine the issue details and confirm whether the issue is genuine
   -  Validate if it can be misused for malicious purposes
   -  Determine its worst case impact and severity
      [Low/Moderate/Important/Critical]

   2) **Response:**

   -  Negotiate embargo timeline (if required, depending on severity)
   -  Request a `CVE <https://cveform.mitre.org/>`__ and open an
      upstream `bug <https://www.qemu.org/contribute/report-a-bug/>`__
   -  Create an upstream fix patch annotated with

      -  CVE-ID
      -  Link to an upstream bugzilla
      -  Reported-by, Tested-by etc. tags

   -  Once the patch is merged, close the upstream bug with a link to
      the commit

      -  Fixed in:

-  Above security lists are operated by select analysts, maintainers
   and/or representatives from downstream communities.

-  List members follow a **responsible disclosure** policy. Any
   non-public information you share about security issues, is kept
   confidential within members of the QEMU security team and a minimal
   supporting staff in their affiliated companies. Such information will
   not be disclosed to third party organisations/individuals without
   prior permission from the reporter(s).

-  We aim to process security issues within maximum of **60 days**. That
   is not to say that issues will remain private for 60 days, nope.
   After the triaging step above

   -  If severity of the issue is sufficiently low, an upstream public
      bug will be created immediately.
   -  If severity of the issue requires co-ordinated disclosure at a
      future date, then the embargo process below is followed, and
      upstream bug will be opened at the end of the embargo period.

   This will allow upstream contributors to create, test and track fix
   patch(es).

Publication embargo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If a security issue is reported that is not already public and its
   severity requires coordinated disclosure, then an embargo date will
   be set and communicated to the reporter(s).

-  Embargo periods will be negotiated by mutual agreement between
   reporter(s), members of the security list and other relevant parties
   to the problem. The preferred embargo period is upto `2
   weeks <https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros>`__.
   However, longer embargoes may be negotiated if the severity of the
   issue requires it.

-  Members of the security list agree not to publicly disclose any
   details of an embargoed security issue until its embargo date
   expires.

CVE allocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each security issue is assigned a `CVE <https://cveform.mitre.org/>`__
number. The CVE number is allocated by one of the vendor security
engineers on the security list.

When to contact the QEMU Security List
--------------------------------------

You should contact the Security List if: \* You think there may be a
security vulnerability in QEMU. \* You are unsure about how a known
vulnerability affects QEMU. \* You can contact us in English. We are
unable to respond in other languages.

When *not* to contact the QEMU Security List
--------------------------------------------

-  You need assistance in a language other than English.
-  You require technical assistance (for example, “how do I configure
   QEMU?”).
-  You need help upgrading QEMU due to security alerts.
-  Your issue is not security related.

How impact and severity of a bug is decided
-------------------------------------------

**Security criterion:** ->
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/security.html

All security issues in QEMU are not equal. Based on the parts of the
QEMU sources wherein the bug is found, its impact and severity could
vary.

In particular, QEMU is used in many different scenarios; some of them
assume that the guest is trusted, some of them don’t. General
considerations to triage QEMU issues and decide whether a configuration
is security sensitive include:

-  Is there any feasible way for a malicious party to exploit this flaw
   and cause real damage? (e.g. from a guest or via downloadable images)
-  Does the flaw require access to the management interface? Would the
   management interface be accessible in the scenario where the flaw
   could cause real damage?
-  Is QEMU used in conjunction with a hypervisor (as opposed to TCG
   binary translation)?
-  Is QEMU used to offer virtualised production services, as opposed to
   usage as a development platform?

Whenever some or all of these questions have negative answers, what
appears to be a major security flaw might be considered of low severity
because it could only be exercised in use cases where QEMU and
everything interacting with it is trusted.

For example, consider upstream commit `9201bb9 “sdhci.c: Limit the
maximum block
size” <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/9201bb9>`__, an of
out of bounds (OOB) memory access (ie. buffer overflow) issue that was
found and fixed in the SD Host Controller emulation (hw/sd/sdhci.c).

On the surface, this bug appears to be a genuine security flaw, with
potentially severe implications. But digging further down, there are
only two ways to use SD Host Controller emulation, one is via
‘sdhci-pci’ interface and the other is via ‘generic-sdhci’ interface.

Of these two, the ‘sdhci-pci’ interface had actually been disabled by
default in the upstream QEMU releases (commit `1910913 “sdhci: Make
device”sdhci-pci" unavailable with
-device" <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/1910913>`__ at
the time the flaw was reported; therefore, guests could not possibly use
‘sdhci-pci’ for any purpose.

The ‘generic-sdhci’ interface, instead, had only one user in ‘Xilinx
Zynq Baseboard emulation’ (hw/arm/xilinx_zynq.c). Xilinx Zynq is a
programmable systems on chip (SoC) device. While QEMU does emulate this
device, in practice it is used to facilitate cross-platform
developmental efforts, i.e. QEMU is used to write programs for the SoC
device. In such developer environments, it is generally assumed that the
guest is trusted.

And thus, this buffer overflow turned out to be a security non-issue.
